- 👋 Hi, I’m @adnankan01
- 👀 I’m interested in: data analysis, machine learning and AI, freelancing and networking with likeminded people.
- With 5 years of experience as a Senior Risk Analyst, I specialize in project planning, stakeholder management,
and risk mitigation. My passion for information systems, data analysis, and strategic initiatives has honed my
expertise in payments, DevOps, fraud prevention, buyer and seller risk, and performance metrics. I am well-
positioned to contribute to senior management within the Implementation and Execution Office, and I am eager
to apply my strong focus and dedicated skills in driving the execution of complex projects as a Compliance
Remediation Associate at Goldman Sachs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and will be learning R next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on business and data analysis projects/work.
